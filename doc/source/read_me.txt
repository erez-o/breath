To build the documentation with Doxygen:

  - download the Doxygen tool from <http://www.doxygen.org/>
  - install it (or unpack it to a folder of your choice if you
    have downloaded the zip/tar.gz file)
  - cd to $BREATH_ROOT/doc/source
  - issue the command path/of/doxygen/doxygen doxygen.cfg
  
The documentation will appear in $BREATH_ROOT/doc.
