This file has had a "tormentata" development history :-)

I had tried using the C++ iostreams but could not find a guaranteed way to turn
off library buffering.

So I tried both POSIX functions and C library. The amount of work for the last
two is more or less the same, and I decided for the C library because it allowed
turning off buffering (although, with no guarantee of actually managing to do so)
while still leaving open the possibility...

However, the C library fread() will simply block if /dev/random cannot provide [cosa? TUTTI i byte, o "nessun byte"?].
Whereas POSIX allows specifying a "non-blocking" mode.

Hence, after several "ondeggiamenti" I went for the POSIX implementation.
